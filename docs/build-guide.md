# Build Guide

The TEMPORAL build process is straightforward and follows similar steps to [Typeractive's Corne wireless build guide](https://docs.typeractive.xyz/build-guides/corne-wireless), which provides excellent reference documentation.

## Key Configuration

Before starting your build, decide on your key configuration (36, 38, 40, 42, or 44 keys). The outer pinky columns can be snapped off the PCB if not needed.

> [!WARNING]
> When removing keys, the break-off points may be sharp - file or sand them smooth. PCB dust is toxic, so wear a mask and work in a well-ventilated area or outside.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microcontroller should be placed **facing DOWN** (i.e. facing the board).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you solder the jumper pads for microcontroller, display, and battery plug closed **on the BACK side of the board** (i.e. the same side you're soldering your hotswap switch plugs and diodes).
