# Wishlist for next version

Considerations for the next design iteration:

- [ ] Add mounting holes near display header (see Typeractive's corne)
- [ ] Add hole near battery JST to allow cables routed under board.
- [ ] Enable the 'extra' outer key (see ergogen yaml, they're already there), with mouse-bites for snap-off options.
