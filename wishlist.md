# Wishlist for next version (v 2)

Considerations for the next design iteration:

- [ ] Add mounting MCU-cover holes near display header (see Typeractive's corne)
- [ ] Add hole near battery JST to allow cables routed under board.
- [ ] Enable the 'extra' outer key (see ergogen yaml, they're already there), with mouse-bites for snap-off options.
- [ ] Move MCU over, more space between inner key col and MCU (see issue [#5](https://github.com/thrly/tempest/issues/5))
- [ ] Fix display connections [#7](https://github.com/thrly/tempest/issues/7)
- [ ] Possibly move thumb-cluster in slightly for less reach on outer thumb. bring the inner thumb key more towards the index col.
